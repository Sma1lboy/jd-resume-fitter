# Privacy Policy for Resume Generator

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the Resume Generator Chrome extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") collects, uses, and shares your information when you use our service. We take your privacy seriously and are committed to protecting your personal information.

## Data Collection and Usage

### Information We Collect

The Resume Generator extension collects the following types of information:

1. **User Profile Information**: Name, contact details, education, skills, work experience, and other resume content that you provide.
2. **Job Descriptions**: Job descriptions that you input or allow the extension to access from web pages.
3. **Generated Resumes**: Resumes created using our extension.
4. **OpenAI API Settings**: Your API key if you choose to use your own OpenAI API account.
5. **Usage Data**: Basic information about how you interact with the extension.

### How We Use Your Information

All the information we collect is used solely for the purpose of:

1. Generating tailored resumes based on job descriptions
2. Saving your profile to avoid re-entering information
3. Maintaining a history of your generated resumes
4. Improving the extension's functionality

## Data Storage

### Local Storage

All your personal information is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API. This includes:

- Your user profile
- Resume templates
- Generated resumes
- Application settings

### External Services

When you use the resume generation feature, the extension sends job descriptions and relevant parts of your profile to OpenAI's API to generate tailored content. This transmission is done securely, and we do not store your data on our servers during this process.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to external parties. The only exception is sharing necessary data with OpenAI for the explicit purpose of generating resume content as requested by you.

## User Control

You have complete control over your data:

- You can view all stored information in the extension settings
- You can delete your profile or history of generated resumes at any time
- You can opt to use your own OpenAI API key

## Security

We implement appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the GitHub repository. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
